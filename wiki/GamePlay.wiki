#summary How the game plays

= Introduction =

This will be a multi-player, networked death-match game.  The user drives a boat while trying to destroy the other players.


= Details =

  * Single player mode (player is the driver and the gunner)
    * Two player mode (one player drives, one player shoots, using the same pc)
  * Multiplayer (each single/two player PC is connected)

There is no timed event, all players start in the "kiddie pool" where weapons are disabled.  Players cross the "DMZ" into the Death Match arena, where weapons are active.

You play until you die, when you respawn in the kiddie pool.
